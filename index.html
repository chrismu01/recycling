      <h2>Why Recycling Is Important</h2>
      <p>
        Recycling reduces waste sent to landfills and incinerators, conserves
        natural resources (like timber, water, and minerals), prevents pollution,
        and saves energy. Every ton of recycled aluminum saves nearly
        <strong>10,000 kWh</strong> of electricity—enough to power an average
        home for about 9 months.
      </p>
      <p>
        By cycling materials back into the production process, we reduce the need
        to extract raw materials, which often involves habitat destruction and
        high carbon emissions.

      <h2>Benefits of Recycling</h2>
      <ul class="two-column-list">
        <li><strong>Conserves Resources:</strong> Gives paper, plastic, and metal
          a second life instead of extracting new materials.</li>
        <li><strong>Saves Energy:</strong> Manufacturing with recycled materials
          often uses significantly less energy.</li>
        <li><strong>Reduces Pollution:</strong> Cuts air and water pollution from
          raw-material extraction and processing.</li>
        <li><strong>Decreases Greenhouse Gases:</strong> Lower CO₂ emissions by
          reducing the energy needed for production.</li>
        <li><strong>Supports Local Economies:</strong> Creates jobs in recycling
          and remanufacturing industries.</li>
        <li><strong>Extends Landfill Life:</strong> Less trash means landfills
          fill up more slowly, delaying the need for new sites.</li>

      <h2>Ways to Recycle Your Own Cans</h2>
      <div class="grid-two-cols">
        <div>
          <h3>1. Rinse and Dry</h3>
          <p>
            Before tossing aluminum or steel cans into the recycling bin, give
            them a quick rinse to remove leftover residue. Dry them out so other
            recyclables stay clean.
          </p>

          <h3>2. Crush to Save Space</h3>
          <p>
            Gently crush cans using your foot (or a can crusher). Flattened cans
            take up less room in your bin or curbside container.
          </p>

          <h3>3. Separate by Material</h3>
          <p>
            If your local recycling program requires sorting, keep aluminum cans
            separate from steel/tin cans. Check with your municipality if they
            accept mixed cans or need them separated.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>4. Use a Storage Bin</h3>
          <p>
            Keep a small “can-only” bucket in your kitchen. Once it’s full, empty
            it into the main recycling bin or take it to a drop‐off center.
          </p>

          <h3>5. Check for Refund Programs</h3>
          <p>
            In some states (like California, Oregon, and Michigan), you can return
            empty aluminum or steel cans for a cash deposit (e.g., 5¢ or 10¢ per
            can). Look up “bottle bill” in your state to see if you qualify.
          </p>

          <h3>6. DIY Projects</h3>
          <p>
            Instead of recycling every can, consider upcycling a few—turn aluminum
            cans into pencil holders, small planters, or lanterns. Just make sure
            you still recycle any leftover scrap.
